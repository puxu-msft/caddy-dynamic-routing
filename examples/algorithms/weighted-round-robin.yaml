# Weighted Round Robin Example
# Requests are distributed sequentially based on weights
# With weights 5:3:2, the pattern repeats every 10 requests:
# backend1, backend1, backend1, backend1, backend1,
# backend2, backend2, backend2,
# backend3, backend3

rules:
  - upstreams:
      - address: backend1:8080
        weight: 5
      - address: backend2:8080
        weight: 3
      - address: backend3:8080
        weight: 2
